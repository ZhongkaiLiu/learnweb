# Notes for Node.js
## Node.js
- with Node.js installed, we can run JS codes on the computer instead of only running on the browser
  - run index.js in terminal
    - `$ node index.js`
  - open the Node.js REPL (Read Evaluation Print Loop)
    - `$ note`
    - just like JS console on the browser

## npm (Node Package Manager)
- npm init
  - `$ npm init`
- npm install packages
  - `$ npm install <package_name>`
- include packages in JS
  - `let package = require("<package_name>")`
